# Matplotlib styles

We have made two Matplotlib style files that we use for formatting figures for this website, presentations, and even papers:

The `ibmq` style uses the following palette of color-blind friendly colors:

```python
['#0075C3', '#ee7733', '#6929c4', '#009988', '#cc3311', '#33bbee', '#ee3377']
```

with a background color of `'#f2f0ed'`.  The order of the colors matters as they are sorted to maximize differences amongst neighboring colors (in grayscale as well).  All text and grids are `black`.

The `ibmq-dark` style uses:

```python
['#00e5cc', '#925cdd', '#f4a67a', '#0099e6', '#f47aa6', '#7ad3f4', '#ef5c3b']
```

on a background of `'#161616'`. Again, the order of the colors is important. All grids and text are `white`.

## Examples

```{eval-rst}

.. jupyter-execute::

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('ibmq')

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    x = np.linspace(0,10,20)
    y1 = np.sin(x)
    y2 = np.sin(x+np.pi/2)
    y3 = np.sin(x+3*np.pi/2)
    ax.plot(x,y1, 'o--')
    ax.plot(x,y2, 'o--')
    ax.plot(x,y3, 'o--')
    ax.set_title('ibmq style');
```

<br/>

```{eval-rst}
.. jupyter-execute::

    plt.style.use('ibmq-dark')

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x,y1, 'o--')
    ax.plot(x,y2, 'o--')
    ax.plot(x,y3, 'o--')
    ax.set_title('ibmq-dark style');
```

## Installation

The [source files are located here](https://github.com/IBM-Quantum-Technical-Enablement/visualization/tree/main/matplotlib/styles).

You can install the files for your local user by first finding the local Matplotlib config directory:

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.get_configdir()
```

and, if needed, creating a directory called `stylelib`.  The style files should be placed within this folder.

## Usage

To load the styles for use simply do (here using the `'ibmq-dark'` style as an example):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ibmq-dark')
```

before rendering the figure that you want stylized.
