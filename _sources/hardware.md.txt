## Eagle processors (127Q)

Eagle processors are 127 qubit systems that feature [3D multi-layer fabrication techniques](https://research.ibm.com/blog/127-qubit-quantum-processor-eagle)
with qubits and readout resonators on different qubit layers connected by through substrate
vias. The processors share many freatures with the Hummingbird systems, including 8x readout multiplexing.  Eagle processors are the first to use conditional qubit reset as the qubit
intialization method.  The Eagle systems will replace Falcon processors as the next-generation
"core" systems.

### R3

A high-coherence version of the Eagle processor.

### R1

The initial version of the Eagle processor.

## Hummingbird processors (65Q)

In essence, a scaled-up 65 qubit version of the Falcon series featuring 8x readout multiplxing.  

### R3

A high-coherence version of the Hummingbird processor.

### R2

Hummingbird processor with incremental improvements over R1.

### R1

The initial version of the Hummingbird processor.

## Falcon processors (27Q)

The current "core" systems offered by IBM Quantum.  These are 27 qubit systems that were the first
to introduce the [heavy-hex toplogy](https://research.ibm.com/blog/heavy-hex-lattice?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=heavy%20hex).  Falcon sytems are bump-bonded to an "interposer" chip that provides readout and signal delivery wiring.  Falcon systems have undergone many revisions and changes over the last two years.

### R8

A high-coherence version of the Falcon processor.

### R6

Introduced [interference couplers](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2011.07050) into the design.

### R5

Improved measurements that are ~7x faster than those found on the R4 systems.  This is achieved via stronger readout coupling strengths and larger dispersive shifts.  This greatly increases output fidelity when using mid-circuit measurements through reduced dephasing.  A more detailed discussion can be found here

### R4

The initial heavy-hex quantum processor.  Also the first to enable mid-circuit measurements.
