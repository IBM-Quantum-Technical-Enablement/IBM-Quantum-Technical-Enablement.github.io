# IBM Hardware

A collection of information on IBM Quantum systems.

## Which device to use?

Deciding which quantum system to use is one of the more challenging questions to answer.  At the level of single qubits, and one- and two-qubit gates, randomized benchmarking is used to give microscope performance information.  However, for quantum circuits over many qubits, this information often does not capture the true performance of a system, and other benchmarks such as [Quantum Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12926) are often used.  Additionally, there are a host of application circuit test suites that look to measure performance over families of circuits for near-term applications.

Here we measure device-wide performance using [discrete time crystal (DTC) characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07625).  In short, the system with the longest bar below is the current top-performing system according to our metric and, all else being equal, the system you should use for best results.  Not surprisingly, the latest systems outperform their older counterparts.

### The system I am using is not in the plot

The figure above includes only those systems that perform above average according to our metric.  Thus any device that is not listed above performs below average, and one may find improvement in results by switching to one of the top performing systems.  Note however that, given the fast pace in quantum computing hardware development, a researcher starting a project on a top performing machine may find that that same machine is no longer listed at a later date.  Given any meaningful project lasts at least 6-12 months, and typically utilizes a single machine, this is to be expected.
