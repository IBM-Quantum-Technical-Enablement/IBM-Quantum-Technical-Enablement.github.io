&lt;p&gt;Here we will demonstrate how to create, upload, and use a custom Program for Qiskit Runtime.  As the utility of the Runtime execution engine lies in its ability to execute many quantum circuits with low latencies, this tutorial will show how to create your own Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) program from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have Qiskit 0.30+ installed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dynamic Bernstein-Vazirani using mid-circuit reset and measurement</title>
    <updated>2021-10-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;The ability to do mid-circuit reset and measurement unlocks a variety of tools for executing quantum circuits.  A brief discussion is given in this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2021/02/quantum-mid-circuit-measurement/"&gt;IBM Research blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  On particular possibility is the ability to reuse qubits, and in doing so reduce the hardware requirements of some algorithms.  The Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithm is one such example.  In particular, when using phase-kickback, BV usually requires a high degree of qubit connectivity to impliment.  This has been used by trapped-ion hardware vendors to show that their hardware gives better fidelity on these problems, e.g. see (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00371"&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00371&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13534-2&lt;/a&gt;).  However, with reset and measurement, BV requires only two qubits, making connectivity differences mute.  We showed this in a reply Tweet: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/nonhermitian/status/1362348935440986113"&gt;https://twitter.com/nonhermitian/status/1362348935440986113&lt;/a&gt;, but did not explain how we got that figure.  So here is how I did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we select the backend and extract its two-qubit gate coupling map.  This is not the same backend used in the original figure as, at the time or writing, that one is offline.  It is however the same processor family and revision.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Choosing the best Qiskit swap mapper</title>
    <updated>2021-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important (perhaps the most important) steps when compiling quantum circuits for architectures with limited connectivity is swap mapping.  If a requested two-qubit gate cannot be implimented directly on hardware, the states of the corresponding qubits must be swapped with those of their neighboors until the states reside on qubits where a two qubit gate is supported.  Swap gates are expensive, equal to three CNOT gates, and therefore moving qubit states around using the fewest number of swap gates is desireable.  Unfortunately, directly computing the minimum number of swap gates is NP-complete, and heuristics need to be developed that come close to the ideal solution while scaling favorably with the number of qubits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qiskit supports a variety of swap mappers and other optimization settings, and how to best set these options is important for getting high-fidelty results.  Additionally, there are other Qiskit compatible compilers out there that should also be evaluated.  To this end, here we look at a selection of circuits compiled with various Qiskit compiler settings, as well as those produced with the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cambridgequantum.com/home/"&gt;Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/CQCL/tket"&gt;Tket compiler&lt;/a&gt;.  We will investigate the performance of these methods in terms of both number of CNOT gates in the output, as well as the associated runtimes.  Because Qiskit swap mappers are stochastic, we will run each one several times and plot the distributions of results.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comparison of Falcon R5 processors verse R4</title>
    <updated>2021-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="ablog-post-excerpt docutils container"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently IBM Quantum announced the move to revision 5 (R5) of its Falcon processors &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jaygambetta/status/1460697559773634570"&gt;see this tweet from Jay Gambetta&lt;/a&gt;.  In particular it was highlighted that there is a 8x reduction in meausrement time on these systems.  Lets see if this, or any other enhancements, are visible from the system calibration data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the recently released Falcon R5 “core” systems is their much improved measurement times (7x) and error rates (2x).  On these systems a measurement is roughly twice as long as a CNOT gate, compared to 13x on the old R4 systems, and allows for implimenting high-fidelity dynamic circuits with resets, mid-circuit measurements, and eventually classically-conditioned gates.  For other tasks, the modest improvements in the CNOT gate errors and &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(T_{1}\)&lt;/span&gt; times are also welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Excited State Promotion (ESP) Readout</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div class="ablog-post-excerpt docutils container"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited State Promotion (ESP) readout is method for decreasing measurement errors in quantum computing systems where decay from the excited &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(|1\rangle\)&lt;/span&gt; state to &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(|0\rangle\)&lt;/span&gt; is non-negligible over the measurement timescales.  Although it was originally an useful technique on the previous generation Falcon R4 systems, today it is only available on a few Falcon R5 systems where the nearly order of magnitude improvement in measurement times leaves little value in using this functionality.  In testing, it looks to even be a bit worse performing than the standard readout method.  ESP readout is on by default for those systems that support it.  To disable it run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many quantum computing platforms one of the two computational basis states, the &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(|1\rangle\)&lt;/span&gt; state by convention, is an excited state of the system with respect to the ground state &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(|0\rangle\)&lt;/span&gt;.  The difference in energy between these two states defines the frequency of the qubit through the relation &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(E=hf\)&lt;/span&gt;.  Because the &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(|1\rangle\)&lt;/span&gt; state is an excited state, there is a non-zero probability that the state will decay to &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(|0\rangle\)&lt;/span&gt; via interaction with the environment.  The characteristic timescale for this is the &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(T_{1}\)&lt;/span&gt; time of the qubit.  When performing gate operations, or non-reversible instructions like measurements on qubits, if the time it takes to perform these operations is a non-negligible fraction of &lt;span class="math notranslate nohighlight"&gt;\(T_{1}\)&lt;/span&gt;, then there is a possibility that this decay has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pitfalls in generating random numbers on quantum computers</title>
    <updated>2021-12-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="ablog-post-excerpt docutils container"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things many beginning quantum practitioners do is try to exploit the random nature of quantum measurements to build a basic random number generator.  Typically they do this via one or more Hadamard gates, and then quickly post an issue saying they do not observe the expected 50/50 outcome of 0’s and 1’s.  Taking this a step further, many companies are looking to commercializing quantum random number generation (QRNG) as a service. These services usually are marketed with words like “true randomness” or “quantum certified”.  Recently news spread of a new QRNG service from
Cambridge Quantum Computing (CQC) called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cambridgequantum.com/our-technology/origin/"&gt;Quantum Origin&lt;/a&gt;. CQC is now part of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.quantinuum.com"&gt;Quantinuum&lt;/a&gt;, a joint venture with Honeywell Quantum Solutions.  This service even has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://cambridgequantum.com/our-technology/origin/origin-partners/"&gt;collection of Partners&lt;/a&gt; attributed to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materials available from CQC suggest that this is essentially the same service as that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2020/09/21/ibm-cqc-intro-cloud-based-quantum-random-number-generation/"&gt;introduced by CQC and IBM over a year ago&lt;/a&gt;.  This service has been a part of Qiskit since the announcement has the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit_rng"&gt;qiskit-rng&lt;/a&gt; module.  Given that this is open source software, we can play around with the code to see why the underlying QRNG method can never be truly “certified” as being quantum in origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
